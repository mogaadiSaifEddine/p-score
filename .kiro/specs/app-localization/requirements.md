# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive internationalization (i18n) support for the Charge-TN scoreboard application. The system will provide localized content for multiple languages including English, French, Spanish, and Icelandic, with dynamic language switching based on URL parameters and user preferences.

## Glossary

- **I18n_System**: The internationalization system that manages language detection, translation loading, and content localization
- **Language_Detector**: Component that identifies the current language from URL parameters and user preferences
- **Translation_Manager**: Service that loads and provides translated strings for the current locale
- **Locale_Switcher**: UI component that allows users to change the application language
- **Theme_Manager**: Service that manages dark/light theme preferences and application
- **Scoreboard_App**: The main application displaying game scores and treasure information
- **Mobile_Component**: The MobileScoreboard component that displays game data on mobile devices

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to view the scoreboard in my preferred language, so that I can understand the game information clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the scoreboard URL with a language parameter, THE I18n_System SHALL display all text content in the specified language
2. WHERE the language parameter is "en", THE I18n_System SHALL display content in English
3. WHERE the language parameter is "fr", THE I18n_System SHALL display content in French
4. WHERE the language parameter is "es", THE I18n_System SHALL display content in Spanish
5. WHERE the language parameter is "is", THE I18n_System SHALL display content in Icelandic

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to automatically detect my language preference, so that I don't have to manually configure it every time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application without a language parameter, THE Language_Detector SHALL determine the preferred language from browser settings
2. IF the browser language is not supported, THEN THE I18n_System SHALL default to English
3. WHEN the language is detected, THE I18n_System SHALL redirect to the appropriate localized URL
4. THE Language_Detector SHALL support language codes "en", "fr", "es", and "is"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between languages during gameplay, so that I can change my language preference without restarting the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Locale_Switcher SHALL display available language options to the user
2. WHEN a user selects a different language, THE I18n_System SHALL update the URL to reflect the new language parameter
3. WHEN the language changes, THE Scoreboard_App SHALL re-render with translated content without losing game state
4. THE Locale_Switcher SHALL indicate the currently selected language

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all user-facing text to be translatable, so that the application can support multiple languages consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Translation_Manager SHALL provide translation keys for all static text in the application
2. THE Mobile_Component SHALL use translation keys instead of hardcoded strings
3. WHEN translation keys are missing for a language, THE I18n_System SHALL fall back to English translations
4. THE I18n_System SHALL support pluralization rules for different languages
5. THE Translation_Manager SHALL handle dynamic content interpolation for game-specific data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a game administrator, I want error messages and game status information to be localized, so that players can understand system feedback in their language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying error messages, THE I18n_System SHALL show localized error text
2. WHEN showing game status updates, THE Scoreboard_App SHALL display translated status messages
3. WHEN validation errors occur, THE I18n_System SHALL provide localized validation feedback
4. THE I18n_System SHALL localize loading states and progress indicators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between dark and light themes, so that I can customize the visual appearance according to my preference and environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Theme_Manager SHALL provide dark and light theme options
2. WHEN a user selects a theme preference, THE Scoreboard_App SHALL apply the corresponding visual styling
3. THE Theme_Manager SHALL persist theme preferences across browser sessions
4. WHEN the system theme changes, THE Theme_Manager SHALL automatically update the application theme if no user preference is set
5. THE Locale_Switcher SHALL include theme selection controls alongside language options
