# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing scoreboard component by making it dynamic through API integration. The scoreboard will fetch real-time data from backend services to display current scores, player statistics, and game information, replacing any static or hardcoded data with live updates.

## Glossary

- **Scoreboard_Component**: The UI component that displays game scores and related information
- **API_Service**: Backend service that provides scoreboard data through HTTP endpoints
- **Score_Data**: Real-time information including current scores, player stats, and game status
- **Mobile_Interface**: The responsive user interface optimized for mobile devices
- **Data_Refresh**: The process of updating scoreboard information from the API

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to see real-time scores on the scoreboard, so that I can stay updated with current game progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Mobile_Interface loads, THE Scoreboard_Component SHALL fetch Score_Data from the API_Service
2. THE Scoreboard_Component SHALL display current scores within 2 seconds of data retrieval
3. WHILE the scoreboard is visible, THE Scoreboard_Component SHALL refresh Score_Data every 30 seconds
4. IF the API_Service is unavailable, THEN THE Scoreboard_Component SHALL display a "Data unavailable" message
5. THE Scoreboard_Component SHALL maintain responsive layout on mobile devices during data updates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see player statistics and game information, so that I can get comprehensive game insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Scoreboard_Component SHALL display player names, scores, and statistics from the API_Service
2. WHEN Score_Data includes game status information, THE Scoreboard_Component SHALL show current game state
3. THE Scoreboard_Component SHALL format numerical data with appropriate precision and units
4. IF player statistics are unavailable, THEN THE Scoreboard_Component SHALL show only available data fields
5. THE Scoreboard_Component SHALL handle varying numbers of players dynamically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the scoreboard to handle network issues gracefully, so that I have a reliable experience even with poor connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity is lost, THE Scoreboard_Component SHALL display the last known Score_Data
2. THE Scoreboard_Component SHALL retry failed API requests up to 3 times with exponential backoff
3. IF API requests fail after retries, THEN THE Scoreboard_Component SHALL show an error indicator
4. WHEN connectivity is restored, THE Scoreboard_Component SHALL resume automatic Data_Refresh
5. THE Scoreboard_Component SHALL provide a manual refresh option for users

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the scoreboard to be performant and efficient, so that it doesn't impact the overall application performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Scoreboard_Component SHALL cache API responses for 10 seconds to reduce redundant requests
2. THE Scoreboard_Component SHALL cancel pending API requests when the component unmounts
3. THE Scoreboard_Component SHALL implement loading states during data fetching
4. THE Scoreboard_Component SHALL optimize re-renders by comparing incoming data with current state
5. THE Scoreboard_Component SHALL handle API response sizes up to 100KB efficiently
